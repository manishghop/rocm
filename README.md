## Enabling cuda on AMD GPU card

**Note**: Tested on following specifications:
  1) RAM 16GB
  2) OS: Ubuntu(22.04.02)LTS
  3) GPU: AMD Radeon 7800XT
  4) CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600x 6-core processor Ã— 12

Steps:

- Install Ubuntu(22.04.02) freshly. I install it as a dual boot option(Win10 & Ubuntu).
- Install ROCm graphics driver depending on your card.
- I had a 7800xt so I installed [https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu-install/23.30.2/ubuntu/jammy/amdgpu-install_5.7.50702-1_all.deb](url)
- Start a terminal & run below commands
- `sudo apt-get update`
- `sudo apt install amdgpu-install_5.7.50702-1_all.deb`
- I also installed anaconda as its much easier to create venv using conda
- Run [curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh](url)
- Mostly curl won't be installed in your fresh ubuntu, so run sudo apt install curl
- Then run bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2020.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
- There will be prompt to accept the license agreement do that.
- Run `source <PATH_TO_CONDA>/bin/activate` [Need to replace the PATH_TO_CONDA to your conda path].
- Hit conda init, this will take you to anaconda shell
- Now, we need to create a conda env with rocm enabled
- Run `conda create -n rocm python=3.10`
- Run `conda activate rocm`
- Since we have rocm 5.7 installed,
- Run `pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm5.7`
- To test cuda is available in pytorch, open a python shell, then run following commands
  `import torch;`
  `torch.cuda.is_available()`
  
  Expected behavior --> True
- But it results in a HIP error, to fix it:
- Simply run `export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0`[We are trying to override the graphic driver version to match 7900xt]/
- Now again test the cuda availble process, it should fix the error.
